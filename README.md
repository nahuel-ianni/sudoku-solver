# Sudoku solver
A Sudoku solver script made in Python with the help of a [backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Backtracking).

## Getting Started
### Installing

If Python isn't already available on your system, follow the instructions found at the official [Python site](https://www.python.org/) to install it on your computer.

### Test management
For this project, [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) and [pytest-cache](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cache/) were used. 
Pytest is a testing tool that will give you more flexibility over running your unit tests.

To install pytest, run the following command:

```pip3 install --user pytest pytest-cache```

*The ``--user`` parameter might be skipped based on user needs.*

### Running the tests
Pytest can easily execute all tests in a file by executing the `pytest` command from the test file's directory.

If you want to execute all tests on a particular file, the command accepts a path as a parameter: `pytest <filename>.py`.
